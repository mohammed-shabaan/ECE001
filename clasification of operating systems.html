Classification of Operating Systems
Operating systems can be classified as follows:

Multi-user: is the one that concede two or more users to use their programs at the same time. Some of O.S permits hundreds or even thousands of users simultaneously.

Single-User: just allows one user to use the programs at one time.

Multiprocessor: Supports opening the same program more than just in one CPU.

Multitasking: Allows multiple programs running at the same time.

Single-tasking: Allows different parts of a single program running at any one time.

Real time: Responds to input instantly. Operating systems such as DOS and UNIX, do not work in real time
