There are different types of operating systems that have been transformed over time. As each operating system has its benefits and downsides,the reason new operating systems have been developing. Now look at the following advantages and disadvantages of an operating system. Computing Source An operating system acts as an interface between the user and the hardware. It allows users to input data, process it, and access the output. Besides, through the operating system, users can communicate with computers to perform various functions such as arithmetic calculations and other significant tasks. Resource Sharing Operating systems allow the sharing of data and useful information with other users via Printers, Modems, Players, and Fax Machines. Besides, a single user can share the same data with multiple users at the corresponding time via mails. Also, various apps, images, and media files can be transferred from PC to other devices with the help of an operating system. No Coding Lines With the invention of GUI, operating systems allow accessing hardware without writing programs. Unlike, earlier users donâ€™t have to write code of lines to access the hardware functionality of a computer system. Disadvantages Expensive When compared to the open-source platforms like Linux, some operating systems are costly. While users can use a free OS but generally they are a bit difficult to run than others. Moreover, operating systems such as Microsoft Windows with GUI functionality and other in-built features carry a costly price tag. System Failure If the central operating system fails, it will affect the whole system, and the computer will not work. Moreover, an OS is the heart of a computer system without which it cannot function. If the central system crashes, the whole communication will be halted, and there will be no further processing of data. Highly Complex Operating systems are highly complex, and the language which used to establish these OS are not clear and well defined. Besides, if thereâ€™s an issue with OS users cannot directly understand, and it cannot be resolved quickly. Virus Threats Threats to the operating systems are higher as they are open to such virus attacks. Many users download malicious software packages on their system which halts the functioning of OS and slow it down.
