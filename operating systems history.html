A brief operating system history In order to find the first operative systems we must travel to the decade of the 50â€™s of the 20th Century. Previously, during the 1940s, programs were introduced directly onto the machine hardware through a series of micro switches. In the 1950s some technologies emerged that allowed a more â€œsimpleâ€‌ interaction between the user and the computer. Resident monitor: this is a system that loads the program into the computer, reading it from a tape or punched cards. This technology gave rise to the first operating system in history, created in 1956 for an IBM 704 computer, which was responsible for loading programs successively (starting with the next one when the previous one had finished loading), reducing the work time required. Temporary storage: this is a system that also tried to increase speed by simultaneously loading programs and executing tasks. In the 1960s, the rise of the integrated circuit launched the power of computers, and operating systems responded by becoming increasingly complex and offering new techniques. Multiprogramming: In this technique, the main memory already holds more than one program, and the operating system is responsible for allocating the machineâ€™s resources to execute tasks based on existing needs. Timeshare: This is a system that assigns the execution of applications within a group of users working online.
